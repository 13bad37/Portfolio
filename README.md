## About This Project

This is my personal portfolio website. I built it to showcase my programming skills and demonstrate what I can do with modern web technologies. It includes interactive elements, smooth animations, and works well on all devices.

## Main Features

**Algorithm Visualizer**
- Shows how different sorting algorithms work step by step
- Includes Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort
- Displays code examples in Python, JavaScript, and C#
- Shows time complexity and other algorithm details
- Lets you control the animation speed

**Animations and Interactions**
- Custom cursor that changes based on what you're hovering over
- Animated background with moving particles
- Smooth transitions between pages
- Optimized for performance
- Respects user preferences for reduced motion

**Responsive Design**
- Works on phones, tablets, and desktop computers
- Touch-friendly controls on mobile devices
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

**Project Showcase**
- Interactive C programming examples
- Portfolio of my work with filtering options

- Contact form for getting in touch

## Technical Details

I used modern tools and practices to build this:

- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- Custom hooks for reusable code

## Design Approach

I went with a dark theme with purple accents because it looks professional and modern. Everything is designed to be easy to read and use, with proper accessibility features.

**Performance**
- Images and components load only when needed
- Optimized code splitting
- GPU acceleration for animations
- Efficient event handling

**Accessibility**
- Proper labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Semantic HTML structure
- Respects user motion preferences

## Featured Projects

**Movie Application**
A movie browsing app with search and filtering features.

**Server Express Application**
Backend application with REST APIs and database integration.

**Hospital Management System**
Healthcare management system built with C# and .NET.
